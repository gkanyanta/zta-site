        <p class="lead">Our juniors programme nurtures the next generation of champions.  Over the past two years the association has hosted a series of youth tournaments and development camps.  Highlights include the IFS Invitational for under‑12 and under‑14 players at Kansanshi Golf Estate – an event sponsored by International Facilities Services and Kansanshi Mining Project – along with the Mike&nbsp;Mambwe Junior Championships and the Love‑40 Top Eight circuit.  These competitions provide high‑quality match play and coaching for our youngest athletes while instilling sportsmanship and a passion for tennis.</p>
